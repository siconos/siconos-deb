The files DLSODE-test.f DLSODES-test.f DLSODA-test.f DLSODAR-test.f DLSODPK-test.f DLSODKR-test.f DLSODI-test.f DLSOIBT-test.f DLSODIS-test.f have been obtained by splitting the original opkddemos file of the distribution of ODEPACK.

The files may be compiled (make all) and executed (make run)and the results are given in the .log file.

Furthermore, DLSODE-test-funC.f funC.c test-funcC-inC.c are given to test the ODEPACK with external C function and the calling of the DLSODE solver trough a C function.

The compatibility between C and Fortran types are ensured by the use of libf2c.
