SFTEMPLATES README FILE
=======================


This directory contains DOUBLE PRECISION code for the algorithms
discussed in the Templates book, implemented using the Reverse
Communicaiton mechanism.

Unpack the shar file as:
 /bin/sh dftemplates.shar

There is are 3 driver programs, 
  Tester.f - main driver,
  dspdchk.f - driver for symmetric positive definite matrix tests,
  dnsychk.f - driver for non-symmetric matrix tests,

The source code corresponding to each iterative method (itmeth) 
resides in 2 files;
  itmeth.f
  itmethREVCOM.f

Iterative methods implemented are:
  BiCG
  BiCGSTAB
  CG
  CGS
  Chebyshev
  GMRES
  Jacobi
  QMR
  SOR
 
Code for 1 stopping test is given in STOPTEST2.f. It corresponds
to the second stopping test discussed in the book.

There is no separate documentation for the code, hopefully the
inline comments will suffice.

The programs can be compiled using the Makefile, which only
requires the standard Fortran 77 compiler (f77). The executable
is called "xdtest". The driver is driven by a data file called
"test.data". Each line of data is commented. Output is generated 
onto stdout, and file "test.results".

So far, the code has only been tested on SUN machines.

Before making your modifications to the code make sure you under-
stand the reverse communication mechanism. Shouldn't take more than
an hour.

Future plans include additional preconditioners, iterative methods,
storage formats, etc.

The software and documentation is available by:

1. sending mail as follows:
  	echo "send index from templates" | mail netlib@www.netlib.org

2. via http:
